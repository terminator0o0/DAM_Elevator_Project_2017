			<li> Worked on Supervisor Node for project with Anas</li>
			<ul>
				<li> The supervisor node will be implemented on the computer in Ubuntu </li>
				<li> Had to download driver and API from peak (http://www.peak-system.com/Software-APIs.305.0.html?&L=1)</li>
				<li> After some pain figuring out the driver, it started to work</li>
				<li> Worked with the API too </li>
				<li> Combined the read and write with switch statement to implemente basic logic</li>
				<li> Supervisor now sends to motor control </li>

			<li> Tested the full project on the Elevator, had some issues</li>
				<ul>
					<li> The motor control was sending at a different location than understood</li>
					<li> Seems like elevator car sometimes stops responding to our requests, whether it be because of sensor or our code, need to figure it out</li>
					<li> For the most part it works </li>
					</ul>
